Welcome!

This extension boilerplate will allow you to run any website as a Chrome Extension. I like this better because I can have a website assigned to a window rather than a Chrome tab.

To Set up your own extension follow the steps below
======

1. Clone this repo on your device (I have it in my linux distro)
1. Open view.html and replace ##YOUR_WEBSITE_NAME## with the name of the website you want to window
2. Open background.js and replace ##ADD_YOUR_URL_HERE## with the url of the website you want to window
3. Open manifest.json and replace ##YOUR_WEBSITE_NAME## and ##YOUR_WEBSITE_DESCRIPTION## with the name and description of the website you want to window
4. replace icon_16.png and icon_128.png with the icon of the website you want to window (one icon to be 16x16px and the other one to be 128x128px)
5. Go to chrome://extensions and enable Developer mode
6. Click on Load Unpacked and select the app folder within this repo
7. Enjoy your windowed app
